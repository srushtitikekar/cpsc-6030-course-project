# Project Overview
The following dashboard illustrates the connections between lifestyle habits and health indicators. It reveals that individuals with higher BMIs tend to have elevated glucose and insulin levels, which may suggest an increased risk of diabetes. There is also a noticeable correlation between diabetes and cholesterol issues, emphasizing the need for a more integrated approach to health management. Data was sourced from the [NHANES CDC 2013-2014](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2013) site.

# Project Process Book
This document shows steps involved in development of our dashboard, including alternative designs we tried and insights we discovered. This will show detail in how we derived at our final product and each step will be described in detail to show the realm of possibilities that we explored. The document does not show ever detail but the important decisions that came along the way.

Steps involved in constructing our dashboard: 
- Overview of Motivation
- Related Work
- Questions That Our Dashboard Could Answer
- Data Source Used And Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Design Evolution
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- References

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
